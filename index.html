							When the mouse hovers over the picture, the throne from Game Of Thrones will appear behind the main subject of the picture. In order to do this, the main picture will have to be replaced with a picture in which the background of the original picture is removed, leaving the subject on his own. Then the picture of the throne will be translated upwards behind the subject so that it looks like the subject is seated on the throne.
